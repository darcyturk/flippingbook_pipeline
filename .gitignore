# .gitignore

# ==============================================================================
#                 Git Ignore File for the Data Pipeline Project
# ==============================================================================
# This file tells Git which files and directories to intentionally ignore.
# It prevents temporary files, generated data, and local environment folders
# from being committed to the repository.

# --- Generated Data ---
# This is the most important rule for this project. We never want to commit
# the output of the pipeline, only the code that generates it.
data/

# --- Log Files ---
# Log files are specific to a single run and should not be version controlled.
pipeline.log
*.log

# --- Python Virtual Environment ---
# The virtual environment folder contains installed packages and is specific
# to the local machine. Each developer should create their own.
venv/
*.venv

# --- Python Cache Files ---
# Python generates these folders to store compiled bytecode. They are
# automatically regenerated and should be ignored.
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# --- IDE and OS-specific files ---
# These are metadata files created by various editors and operating systems.

# macOS
.DS_Store

# Visual Studio Code
.vscode/
